Our web application is designed to revolutionize healthcare accessibility and user engagement by 
seamlessly integrating cutting-edge technology with community support. Addressing common 
challenges in traditional healthcare systems such as long wait times and limited access to 
specialists; our platform offers users a comprehensive solution. Leveraging Convolutional Neural 
Network (CNN) models, users can upload images for prompt and accurate disease detection, 
while a dedicated consultation section connects them with healthcare professionals for expert 
advice. Furthermore, our community forum fosters a supportive environment for sharing 
experiences and seeking peer-to-peer support. With interactive features like customizable user 
profiles, medication reminders, and health trackers, our platform empowers users to manage 
their health effectively. By streamlining appointment scheduling and providing a rich library of 
health tips and articles, we aim to promote proactive health management and empower users to 
take control of their well-being.
